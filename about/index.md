The Graduate Research Fellows Program provides a structured and guided forum for graduate students to engage with each other and experts in the field of digital humanities around project design and management, data modeling and management, digital publication, and digital humanities pedagogy.

CESTAâ€™s Graduate Research Fellows program is designed to prepare graduate students for a future where digital scholarship is the norm. The program provides a co-working environment and community of practice in which to design, develop, and workshop digital research projects-in-progress. The Fellows are an integral part of the CESTA community and meet regularly throughout the year to learn digital humanities research methods and engage in group discussions on relevant topics in the digital humanities.

Digital humanities research is by necessity collaborative. For the collaboration to be successful, we devote significant time and attention to building a cohort. Intellectual exchange is fostered in a context intimate enough for social interactions to emerge. At the same time, the Graduate Research Fellows benefit from cross-fertilization with the Spatial History Lab, the Literary Lab, Humanities + Design, Poetic Media,and a wide range of other project work going on at CESTA.
