  bio: "A native Mainer, George Philip loves being in museums as much as being outdoors. His research has led him from the mountains of Switzerland, where he was a Fulbright Scholar, to the coast of California, where he now resides as a Doctoral Candidate at Stanford, writing a dissertation about the art and science of Arctic exploration. As an art historian, he divides his time between curating, writing, teaching and large format photography. Even the most cursory internet search will expose his checkered past an an a cappella nerd, but he also loves rowing, cycling, and baking bread _Ã  l'ancienne_."
